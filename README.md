# Half-Duplex-TCP-IP-connection-using-python
Server code and Client code are given seperately.
This is a half duplex connection as at one time only one of client or server can send data. This is achieved by making one single function to perform both the operations of sending and recieving data and the order in which the operations are coded determines which order the messages will be sent and recieved by the client and the server.
